WPMS Network Global Inserts allow wordpress multisite network admin to insert html in the content accross the network


Description
--------------

This plugin is strongly based on the code `WPMS Global Content` from `Neerav Dobaria`.
I really liked that plugin, but i thought it could do more, so i added some 
things that it also can insert adsense accross a Wordpress 3.3 network installation.

Example Usage
--------------

Just install and activate, fill out the fields in the backend. Only a Network 
Administrator can fill it out, even it is in the Administration and not 
Network Administration. 
The field you dont want to print, just let them empty. The blog id you want 
to exclude is `0` if you want to print it out on all.

If you have a post where is a `read more` in it, it will print the center 
right there, if you dont have a read more, it will not give out the content 
center. If the content center is print out, it will not print out the content 
header. In your frontpage or archive on your blog, it only prints three html 
messages, so you can use it for Google Adsense. The Header and Footer is on the 
main site and it will allways print.
