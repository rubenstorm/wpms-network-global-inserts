 * <p>WPMS Network Global Inserts allow Wordpress multisite network admin to <br />
 * insert html in the content accross the network</p>
 * 
 * <p>This plugin is strongly based on the code `WPMS Global Content` from `Neerav Dobaria`. <br />
 * I really liked that plugin, but i thought it could do more, so i added some <br />
 * things that i also can insert adsense accross a Wordpress 3.3 network installation.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Installation</b></p>
 * <p>Just upload the folder in your pluginfolder. Go to the Network admin and <br />
 * activate it network wide. The configuration area is then in the admin desktop <br />
 * on Blog No. 1. {@link wpmsngi::on_activate()}</p>
